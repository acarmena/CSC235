# In this fun assignment, we will learn about variables and data types, along with user input and output. We will also learn how to read and write files in Python.

# Guidelines:
# - Clearly demonstrate your mastery over input and output to the user while holding different types and sizes of data in variables.
# - Think of how data persistence would benefit the UX of your App.
# - What data would you like your program to persist between uses?
# - Maybe Save the Game, Save inventory, Save user Info?

# Requirements:
# Add user input and output to your application.
# Add at least two variables holding different data types to your application.
# Write data to a text file.
# Read data from a text file.
# Your read and writes should add something useful to your application, not just demo how to read and write to and from a text file.
# Overcomment your source code file (.py) well.
# This program should have a great user experience.
# OPTIONAL NOT REQUIRED: Use functions in your program
